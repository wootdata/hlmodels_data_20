This is my first ever model... are you happy for me? I can see that you are by the size of your pipe bomb.

Programs Used : Lightwave 6.5 (Modeler)
		Milkshape 3D 1.5.6
		Adobe Photoshop 6.0
		Virtual Jenna (Stress Relief)

Files Stolen  : I have rmodeled The Flash for this... sorry... I'm bad. I hear that it's a remake of The 
			Punisher, so hugs 'n' kisses go out to whoever modeled those for me to rip off.

This is the 3D version of a cartoon character I invented in high school. There's more to him, but I suck at modeling. There will eventually be more characters and a remake of this one.

Stay Tuned for the rest of The Hero Gang.

   XOXOXOXOXOXO and a pump from behind,
